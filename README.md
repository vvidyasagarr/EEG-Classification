EEG Classification for Schizophrenia

Introduction

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique for measuring the electrical activity of the brain.
This technology is commonly used for diagnosing various neurological conditions, including schizophrenia.
The aim of EEG classification for schizophrenia is to develop machine learning algorithms that can accurately
identify patients with this disorder based on their EEG signals.

Data Collection

EEG signals are collected from patients with schizophrenia and healthy individuals.
The EEG signals are typically recorded while the subjects are resting with their eyes closed or performing simple tasks,
such as counting or imagining movements.
The collected EEG data is then divided into training and testing sets for use in the machine learning algorithms.

Feature Extraction

Before the EEG signals can be used for classification,they must be processed to extract relevant features.
This involves transforming the raw EEG signals into numerical representations that capture the underlying patterns in the data.
Commonly used feature extraction methods include power spectral density (PSD) analysis, time-frequency analysis, and independent component analysis (ICA).

Classification Algorithms

Once the features have been extracted from the EEG signals,
various machine learning algorithms can be applied for classification.
Commonly used algorithms include support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, random forests, and deep neural networks (DNN).
The performance of these algorithms is typically evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
